    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>My name is Anshul Shrivastava, and I am a passionate and dedicated individual pursuing a Bachelor of Technology degree in Electrical & Electronics Engineering with a minor in Computer Science & Engineering at Shiv Nadar University. I have always been intrigued by technology and its ability to transform lives, which led me to explore various technical skills and enhance my knowledge in different programming languages such as Java, C, Apex, HTML & CSS, React JS, Bootstrap, and MATLAB.</p>
    <p>Throughout my academic journey, I have strived for excellence and maintained an impressive academic record, achieving an 8.15 CGPA in my current program. In addition to my technical skills, I possess strong soft skills such as problem-solving, teamwork, good communication, and logical thinking, which have proven instrumental in my professional development.</p>

As a Catalyst Developer at Salesforce, I actively engaged in live boot camps and received expert guidance, allowing me to gain practical experience in the Salesforce technology stack. I also completed the prestigious Super Badge in Apex Specialist and Process Automation Specialist.
